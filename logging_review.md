# LOGGING AUDIT REPORT

## 1. ZeroBounce Validator (zerobounce_validator.py)

### Current Logging:
✅ **Startup:**
- Priority config fetch
- Country selection
- Batch size

✅ **Processing:**
- Leads fetched count
- Emails being validated
- Validation API response
- Individual lead updates with status

✅ **Errors:**
- Priority API failures
- Validation API failures
- Database update failures

### Recommended Additions:
- [ ] Log current country being processed
- [ ] Log validation rate (valid/invalid breakdown)
- [ ] Log API credits remaining (if available)

---

## 2. HubSpot Duplicate Checker (hubspot_duplicate_checker.py)

### Current Logging:
✅ **Startup:**
- Batch size and start_id
- Leads fetched count

✅ **Processing:**
- Individual lead processing (ID + email)
- Match types (email, phone, name)
- Update success/failure

✅ **Errors:**
- API errors for HubSpot
- API errors for Airtable
- Database update failures

### Recommended Additions:
- [ ] Summary stats at end (duplicates vs unique)
- [ ] Log when no leads found to process
- [ ] Log deal/contact IDs when found

---

## 3. Record Fetching Logic Verification

### ZeroBounce Validator:
```
QUERY: contacts_grid_view WHERE:
  - country IN (priority_countries) OR country IS NULL
  - zerobounce_status IS NULL
  - email IS NOT NULL AND email != ''
ORDER BY: created_at
LIMIT: batch_size
```
✅ CORRECT - Fetches unprocessed leads

### HubSpot Checker:
```
QUERY: contacts_grid_view WHERE:
  - zerobounce_status = 'valid'
  - zerobounce_processed = TRUE
  - hubspot_check_2_completed IS NULL/FALSE
  - email IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY: id
LIMIT: batch_size * 10 (client-side filter to batch_size)
```
✅ CORRECT - Fetches validated but unchecked leads

---

## 4. Missing Logging for Production:

### Both Scripts Need:
- [ ] **Start/End timestamps** for each batch
- [ ] **Processing duration** metrics
- [ ] **Success/failure counts** summary
- [ ] **Rate limiting** information
- [ ] **Database connection** status

### For Cron Jobs:
- [ ] **Exit codes** (0 = success, 1 = failure)
- [ ] **JSON summary** at end for parsing
- [ ] **Error alerting** (critical vs warning)
